# The ACHSC Syllabus

## What is the ACHSC?

We are a not-for-profit, student-run organisation that has developed the High School Cancer Challenge for Victorian secondary school students after seeing a need to create an environment for young people to learn about cancer. More information can be found at [our website](http://www.achsc.org.au/).

## How to use the syllabus

This syllabus contains all the content for the annual High School Cancer Challenge. If you're attending, you should read through and familiarise yourself with it before the day. There are a couple of features to be aware of.

* Throughout the syllabus, you will come across terms highlighted in green. These are glossary items, which you can hover over or click on to see their definition.

{% hint style='info' %}
* Blue boxes like this one will appear occasionally. They will help you to extend your knowledge by putting the information into context and giving you a feel for modern cancer research.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style='tip' %}
* Green boxes such as this will be more common, and they contain links to other reputable sources for relevant information on cancer. Use them to get an alternative take on the syllabus content, or to challenge yourself by going beyond the course. Nothing that isn't in our syllabus will be examined, but reading beyond the syllabus is a good way to put your knowledge of its content into practice.

* You can search the syllabus using the search box in the upper left hand corner of the screen.

<!--* If any questions come to mind as you're working through, add a comment using the little grey plus sign that will appear to the right of the relevant paragraph when you mouse over it. We'll answer it as quickly as we can, and that way other students can see the information as well.-->
