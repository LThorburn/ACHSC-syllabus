## Antibodies

Antibodies, also known as immunoglobulins are very specialised molecules that are produced by plasma cells \(a specialised B cell\) to help neutralise foreign invaders by binding and preventing their action. Each antibody can recognise a specific foreign invader because each antibody has slightly different binding regions.

## Antigen

An '**anti**body **gen**erator'. An antigen is any foreign substance that will trigger an immune response. It can be pollen particles, bacteria, virus, fungi, parasite, chemical etc.

## Autosome

Any chromosome that is not needed for sex determination, i.e. not a sex chromosome.

## Basement membrane

A thin meshwork of connective tissue, to which a layer of epithelial cells are anchored.

## Cell junctions

The connections between epithelial cells.

## Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition

Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition: the migration of epithelial cells and the loss of epithelial characteristics.

## EMT

Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition: the migration of epithelial cells and the loss of epithelial characteristics.

## Free radicals

Any molecule that has an unpaired electron in an outer shell.  They are usually very reactive because they are unstable. To make themselves more stable they will 'attack' other molecules to form a stable pair of electrons. They may be formed through metabolism or gained from the environment.

## Leukocytes

White blood cells, part of the innate immune system, such as neutrophils and macrophages

## Loss-of-Function Mutation

Those that cause the mutated gene to have less or no function \(being partially or wholly inactivated\).

## Loss-of-Function Mutations

Those that cause the mutated gene to have less or no function \(being partially or wholly inactivated\).

## Mutagen

An agent that causes a mutation in DNA. Includes radioactive substances, x-rays, UV radiation, gamma radiation, and certain chemicals \(e.g. heterocyclic amines\).

## Organ

A largest part of an organism, composed of tissues that perform similar functions.

## Pleura

Membranes which line the chest wall and cover the lungs.

## Model Organism

A model organism is a non-human species that is extensively studied to understand particular biological phenomena, with the expectation that discoveries made in the organism model will provide insight into the workings of other organisms.

## Pathogen

A microorganism, such as bacterium or virus, that causes disease.

## Self-sufficiency

Self sufficiency is an acquired ability where the cell does not need external signals, such as growth factors, to grow and proliferate. It is the first hallmark of cancer and can be due to mutations in the cell cycle.
