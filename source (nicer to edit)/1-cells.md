## What is a Cell?

![](https://visualsonline.cancer.gov/retrieve.cfm?imageid=9750&dpi=72&fileformat=jpg)

Mammalian cells are enclosed by a plasma membrane, which consists of a lipid bilayer. The space enclosed by the plasma membrane is called the cytoplasm. Organelles, which are integral to the functioning of the cell, are found in the cytoplasm. Organelles include:

* **Nucleus** The nucleus contains most of the cell’s DNA molecules organised into structures called chromosomes. To activate genes, proteins need to enter the nucleus via pores.

* **Endoplasmic Reticulum** There are two types of ER: rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). RER is studded with ribosomes, while SER lacks ribosomes. Ribosomes are complex molecular machines that are important for protein synthesis and can be found both bound to RER and free in the cytoplasm.

* **Golgi Apparatus** The Golgi is a series of flattened membrane-bound sac where proteins made in the ER are modified, sorted and packaged for transport to their eventual destinations within the cell. 

* **Mitochondria** The mitochondrion is enclosed in a double membrane: an inner membrane and an outer membrane. The mitochondrion is often described as the ‘powerhouse’ of the cell because it generates most of the cell’s supply of energy.

* **Lysosome** The lysosome is a membrane-bound sac containing enzymes, which digests proteins and other cellular byproducts.

## DNA & the Central Dogma

{% youtube %}https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIvBn6gfRgY{% endyoutube %}

All of the instructions that a cell needs to produce its proteins are encoded in its DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). A DNA molecule is a double stranded α-helix, consisting of a backbone made up of phosphate and deoxyribose sugars, with nitrogenous bases acting like rungs of a ladder, connecting the two strands. There are four bases - guanine (G), cytosine (C), adenine (A), and thymine (T). G and C are complementary to each other, as are A and T, meaning that their structure allows them to fit nicely together, like a lock and key. Hydrogen bonds link these complementary bases together, thereby connecting the two DNA strands. A phosphate group connected to deoxyribose sugar and a nitrogenous base is known as a nucleotide. 

The total length of DNA in a single cell is approximately 2 metres! How does this all fit inside such a tiny cell? Well, to achieve this, DNA is wrapped around proteins, called histones. It is then coiled into a structure called a chromosome. In the nucleus of all human cells, there are 23 pairs of chromosomes, 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes. Our chromosomes and genes are highly regulated and well balanced like a old recipe, any deviation in the amount of chromosomes or genes are generally not well tolerated and can be the basis of cancer development. [See [Genetic Basis of Cancer](https://achsc.gitbooks.io/syllabus/content/2-genes.html#genetic-basis-of-cancer)]

{% hint style='info' %}
Did you know that humans share about 50% of the same genome as the fruit fly? It is not too surprising given that all organisms share a common ancestor who lived a billion years ago. Although we may share a conserved genome, the difference is in the expression of our genes.
{% endhint %}

![](https://visualsonline.cancer.gov/retrieve.cfm?imageid=10062&dpi=72&fileformat=jpg)

Each DNA molecule can be divided into millions of smaller segments called genes. Humans have an estimated 19,000-20,000 genes. The size of a gene can vary from as few as 100 base pairs to as many as 80,000 base pairs. Each gene contains the instructions needed for the production of precisely one protein. The process by which a cell uses the instructions encoded by a gene to produce a protein is described in the central dogma of molecular biology, which was first proposed by Francis Crick, co-recipient of the 1962 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.

![](/assets/Central Dogma.png)

###Transcription
When a cell is ready to produce a protein, an enzyme called RNA polymerase II comes along and unwinds the DNA molecule at the position of the gene that encodes that protein. RNA polymerase II then uses one of the DNA strands as a template to synthesise a messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule in a process called transcription. The mRNA molecule is then processed: a 7-methylguanylate cap is added to the start of the molecule, sections of the molecule are spliced out, and a poly(A) tail is added to the end of the molecule. After RNA processing, mRNA molecule is then exported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm. 

###Translation
In the cytoplasm, a ribosome comes along and binds to the mRNA molecule. The ribosome recruits transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules carrying specific amino acids to the mRNA molecule, and then joins the amino acids together to form the protein in a process called translation. The newly synthesised protein then wanders off to perform its specific function. Hence, the central dogma can be distilled to the following statement: genetic information flows from DNA to RNA to protein.

{%mcq ans='o1' %}
{%title%} Which of the following statements about DNA and the Central Dogma is correct?
{%o1%} In a non-mutated DNA segment, the number of cytosine nucleotides is equal to the number of guanine molecules.
{%o2%} RNA polymerase I uses DNA as a template to synthesize mRNA during transcription.
{%o3%} A nucleotide consists of a nitrogenous base bound to a deoxyribose sugar.
{%o4%} After RNA processing, the mRNA molecule will have crossed 2 phospholipid bilayer membranes.
{%message%} Correct!
Because cytosine pairs with guanine, then in a non-mutated (i.e. "normal") segment of DNA, the number of cytosine nucleotides should be equal to the number of guanine nucleotides.

The other statements are incorrect:___
B: It is RNA polymerase II (not I) that uses DNA as a template  to synthesize mRNA during transcription.___
C: Never forget the phosphate group. The nucleotide includes the phosphate group. Without the phosphate group, the molecule is just known as a "nucleoside" ('s" instead of "t").___
D: After RNA processing, the mRNA molecule is exported out of the nucleus. The nucleus only contains 1, not 2, phospholipid bilayer membrane.

## Cell Cycle

{% youtube %}https://youtu.be/U5vAO_f2LDQ{% endyoutube %}

The cell cycle refers to the sequence of events that cells go through to divide and replicate. It consists of a number of phases:

| State | Phase | Code | Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Resting | Quiescence | G<sub>0</sub> | Some cells leave the cell cycle and enter a 'resting' phase call the G<sub>0</sub> phase. Such cells are called senescent cells. Examples of senescent cells include neurons and cardiac muscle cells. |
| Interphase | Growth 1 | G<sub>1</sub> | The cell grows in size. The G<sub>1</sub> checkpoint ensures that the cell is ready for DNA synthesis. |
| Interphase | Synthesis | S | The cell replicates its DNA. After S phase, the amount of DNA in the cell doubles. |
| Interphase | Growth 2 | G<sub>2</sub> | The cell continues to grow. The G<sub>2</sub> checkpoint ensures that cell is ready for mitosis. |
| Dividing | Mitosis | M | The cell stops growing. The cell passes through a number of phases \(prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase and cytokinesis\), at the end of which the cell divides into two genetically identical daughter cells. |

The cell cycle is very important in growth and repair of tissues. Cells of different tissues go through the cycle at different rates which depend largely on microenvironment of the cell and its intrinsic nature. Some cells like epithelial skin cells are constantly entering the cell cycle because they are continually under stress from the environment, other cells such as liver cells are usually resting but will enter the cell cycle when there is injury or damage and the rest are permanent cells meaning they have no ability to divide. Typical cancer cells are like epithelial cells in that they are constantly dividing at a fast rate.

{%mcq ans='o4' %}
{%title%} Which of the following statements about the cell cycle is correct?
{%o1%} A cell with chromosome damage is likely to reach the G2 phase.
{%o2%} Liver resection (removal) is a dangerous surgery because liver function is likely to be terminally compromised.
{%o3%} Because tumor cells contain many DNA mutations, they are unlikely to pass the G2 phase.
{%o4%} None of the above.
{%message%} All of the statements are incorrect:___

A: A cell with chromosome damage is unlikely to even pass the G1 phase and enter the S phase. The cell will likely undergo apoptosis due to chromosome damage.___
B: Liver resection, like many surgeries, poses a risk of infection. This would be a more likely reason for "danger." And because the liver can regenerate, there is no "terminal compromising" of its function.___
C: Tumor cells actually exploit the cell cycle by constantly stimulating the M phase, thus leading to uncontrolled cell division. It is actually the mutations that increase the capability of a cancer cell to bypass checkpoints of the cell cycle.

## Cell Signalling

If cells enter the cell cycle and duplicate themselves whenever they want, the body may end up with too many cells, more than what it needs. If the body doesn’t put a stop to this uncontrolled growth, it may end up with a tumour. So it’s really important to regulate where and when a cell enters the cell cycle.

How does a cell know when to enter the cell cycle? It needs to be told what to do somehow. This is where cell signalling comes in.

When a cell is required to divide and replicate, three things happen:

1. **The cell receives a specific signal to start the cell cycle**
2. **The message is passed on inside the cell to the nucleus**
3. **The cell responds to the message and enters the cell cycle**

Now let’s look at each stage in more detail.

#### 1. The cell receives a specific signal to start the cell cycle

- A signalling molecule (in this case a growth factor) binds to a receptor (growth factor receptor) on the outside of the cell.
- The receptor usually has 3 domains: 
    - an extracellular domain (outside the cell)
    - a transmembrane domain (straddles the lipid bilayer) 
    - a cytoplasmic domain (inside the cell)
- The growth factor binds to the extracellular domain of the growth factor receptor in a lock-and-key fashion .

#### 2. The message is passed on inside the cell to the nucleus

- Binding of the growth factor to the extracellular domain of the growth factor receptor causes the cytoplasmic domain of the growth factor receptor to undergo some change.
- This change is detected by special proteins inside the cytoplasm of the cell called kinases.
- These kinases then initiate a cascade of reactions inside the cell that typically ends with a transcription factor moving from the cytoplasm into the nucleus.

#### 3. The cell responds to the message and enters the cell cycle

- The once transcription factors enter the nucleus, they start to activate certain genes.
- These genes are required for progression through the cell cycle.
- The cell thus enters the cell cycle.


{% hint style='info' %}
To give you a taste of how long and convoluted these signalling pathways can be, here is an overview of one of the most well-known: the Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk pathway, which is affectionately abbreviated to **Ras**.

1. The Ras-Raf-Mek-Erk signalling pathway begins with a growth factor binding to a growth factor receptor.
2. Binding of growth factor to the receptor causes the receptor to activate itself.
3. GRB2 is a protein inside the cell that can recognise when the receptor is activated.
4. GRB2 binds to the activated receptor.
5. SOS is another type of protein that binds to the GRB2-receptor complex.
6. After SOS docks onto GRB2, it activates another protein called Ras. 
7. Ras then activates a protein called Raf. 
8. Raf then activates a protein called Mek. 
9. Mek then activates a protein called Erk. 
10. Erk then activates a transcription factor, which moves from the cytoplasm into the nucleus to activate expression of Myc, which is itself a transcription factor. 
11. After Myc is produced, Myc remains in the nucleus to activate expression of Cyclin D. 
12. Cyclin D then forms a complex with CDK4. 
13. The Cyclin D/CDK4 complex then activates a protein called Rb, which is usually bound to another protein called E2F.
14. Activation of Rb results in letting go of E2F.
15. E2F is now free to activate expression of Cyclin E and Cyclin A, two genes that push the cell from G1 phase to S phase.
{% endhint %}

### When things go wrong

It is a breakdown in the signalling pathways that control how a cell grows, divides and dies that can cause it to become cancerous. We'll talk more about this in the [Hallmarks of Cancer](https://achsc.gitbooks.io/syllabus/1-cancer.html#hallmarks-of-cancer) section.


{% hint style='info' %}
For example, problems with the Ras pathway can cause cancers of the eye or cervix.

**Retinal Cancer** In humans, the gene that encodes Rb is located on the long arm of chromosome 13. If both copies of the Rb gene is mutated in retinal cells, then the cell loses the ability to produce Rb. As a result, E2F becomes free to drive progression from G1 phase to S phase even in the absence of growth factor signalling. Retinal cells divide and replicate in an unregulated fashion, leading to the development of retinoblastoma, which is the most common malignant cancer of the eye in children. Although most children survive this cancer, some may lose vision in the affected eye, or need to have the eye removed. 

**Cervical Cancer** The human papillomavirus (HPV), after it infects the keratinocytes of the cervix, produces a protein called E7, which binds to Rb, preventing E2F from binding. As a result, E2F, again, becomes free to drive progression from G1 to S phase even in the absence of growth factor signalling. Keratinocytes divide and replicate in an unregulated fashion, leading to the development of cervical cancer, which is the fourth most common cancer in women.

## Types of Tissues

A group of cells with similar structure and function are organised into tissues. The four main types of tissue are epithelial tissue, connective tissue, muscular tissue and nervous tissue. Tissues are then arranged into organs.

| Tissue | Features |
| :--- | :--- |
| Epithelial | Lines body surfaces, including skin and the lining of the oesophagus and lungs. |
| Connective | Includes blood, dermis, bone and lymph. Lymph tissue makes up a large part of the immune system and helps to transport white blood cells to and from the bloodstream. |
| Muscular | Includes skeletal (voluntary), smooth (involuntary e.g. oesophagus) and cardiac (involuntary) muscle. |
| Nervous | Comprises neurons. |

![Examples of the 4 main tissue types and where they can be located. The tissues have been stained via specialised processes to visualise the cells. Connective tissue consists of mostly loosely connect proteins for structure. Epithelial tissues are full of closely packed cells so that they form an effective barrier and to regulate movement of molecules. Muscle tissue are composed of contractile cells that are usually closely associated so they can work in unison. Nervous tissue contain cells that can generate electrical signals to control body functions. - Diagram sourced from <a href="http://philschatz.com/anatomy-book/contents/m46046.html">here</a>, an excellent online anatomy textbook. Download for free at <a href="http://cnx.org/contents/14fb4ad7-39a1-4eee-ab6e-3ef2482e3e22@8.24">http://cnx.org/contents/14fb4ad7-39a1-4eee-ab6e-3ef2482e3e22@8.24</a>.](http://philschatz.com/anatomy-book/resources/401_Types_of_Tissue.jpg)

Cells in each type of tissue are arranged and connected to each other differently. This allows tissues to have different characteristics and functions. For example, epithelial cells are intimately connected with their neighbours by different types of cell junctions. A layer of epithelial cells is also anchored to a thin meshwork of connective tissue, known as the basement membrane. These connections are very strong, and are the reason why skin is resistant to stretching and other stresses. As a consequence, epithelial cells have a specific orientation; one side must be connected to the basement membrane, and others must be linked to adjacent epithelial cells. On the other hand, some cells in connective tissues (e.g. red blood cells) are not connected to their neighbours and are therefore more mobile. This means that abnormalities can arise when tissues lose their characteristics. For example, if cells in epithelial tissues lose their cell junctions, they can become detached from the basement membrane and might enter the bloodstream. The migration of epithelial cells and the loss of epithelial characteristics are known as epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT is a key step in many cancers and is the reason to how cancers are spread in the body.

{%mcq ans='o2' %}
{%title%} Which of the following statements about tissues is correct?
{%o1%} Blood is not connective tissue.
{%o2%} Blocking the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process (e.g. via an anti-TGFbeta antibody), is a theoretical means of slowing cancer progression.
{%o3%} The nuclei of epithelial tissue are spread in a relatively diffuse and non-uniform pattern.
{%o4%} If considering distance only (in the absence of other factors), then a tumor that begins development in the muscle, is less likely to metastasize than a tumor that begins development in the submucosa.
{%message%} Correct! The EMT process allows cancer cells to metastasize (spread to other parts of the body). A potential process implicated in this is the TGF-beta signaling pathway. Research into therapies that target the TGF-beta signaling pathway may have some promise for use against cancer cells. For your interest, here is a paper that discusses such a treatment: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163725814002010 ___

The other statements are incorrect:___
A: Blood is actually a connective tissue. It contains many mobile elements, e.g. red blood cells, white blood cells, proteins in plasma, that are not explicitly "connected" (e.g. like epithelial cells are).___
C: The diagram of epithelial tissue shows the nuclei being more uniform. Connective tissue nuclei are spread in a more diffuse and non-uniform pattern (likely because the cells are mobile, and not primarily held in place like epithelial cells are).___
D: This is just a fancy/complicated way of testing the recognition that the progression from surface to deeper layers is: mucosa --> submucosa --> muscle --> connective tissue --> lymph node. Once the cancer reaches the lymph node, it is more likely to metastasize. Thus, a cancer that starts in the muscle is more likely to metastasize than a cancer that starts in the submucosa. However, that is only in the consideration of distance. There are of course many other properties (e.g. angiogenesis, expression of immune-suppressing proteins) of cancer cells that determine how "fast" metastatic potential can be acquired.
